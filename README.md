# Enhanced Gaussian Process Modeling Method

* **Summary**: This enhanced Gaussian process (GP) modeling method is initiated by Ramin Bostanabad in my [lab](http://ideal.mech.northwestern.edu/). I collaborated with Ramin and Tucker Kearney in developing and testing this enhanced method. We have written and submitted a journal paper on this method titled "Leveraging the Nugget Parameter for Efficient Gaussian Process Modeling", currently under review of IJNME (International Journal for Numerical Methods in Engineering). The new method has been developed as an R package named "GPM" and can be locally installed via zip or tar.gz files (see below).

* **File descriptions**:
  * "GPM_1.0.tar.gz": GPM package for local installation
  * "GPM_1.0.zip": GPM package for local installation
  * "GPM_1.0_source": folder containing source code of the GPM package
  * "datasets&results": folder containing test datasets and the saved result files
  * "GPM&GPfit_test_Ex1thru7_SaveInTime.R" script for testing the new method against the existing method (package) "GPfit"
